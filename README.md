# COMPETEC

COMPETEC is a project of PET-SI (Tutorial Education Program of Information Systems) in College of Arts, Sciences and Humanities (EACH) of University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP).

In this project, scolarship students of PET-SI (I was one of them during 2019 and the begging of 2020) give classes of Introduction to Programming using Java programming language for students of public secundary-technical schools.

These classes are a mix of short normal classes + "Programming Dojo Dynamic", which is a dynamic that all present students at the class try to find solutions for a Programming Challenge about the class topic they studied that day.
